        <h1>External Styles</h1>

            This is demonstrative of external style sheets.<br>
            External styles are CSS rules written in a separate file (with a .css extension) and linked to the HTML document using the &lt;link&gt; tag in the &lt;head&gt; section. 
            This approach allows you to apply the same styles to multiple web pages, making your website easier to maintain and update. 
            By keeping style information separate from the HTML structure, external style sheets promote cleaner code and better organization.
